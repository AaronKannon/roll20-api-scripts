# Roleplaying is Magic 4E dice

*v1.1 Updates*
* The script now has an API, mainly to integrate with the TrapTheme for MLP:RiM 4E character sheets.

This is a script for rolling dice checks and skill checks for the
[Roleplaying is Magic: Season 4 edition](http://roleplayingismagic.com/),
a popular fan-created tabletop RPG system based upon the world of
My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and developed by Roan Arts.

This script is utilized by the [Roleplaying is Magic 4E character sheet](https://github.com/Cazra/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/RoleplayingIsMagic_4E).
It can be used either by using the chat command documented in the script or
with the dice rolling buttons the character sheet's Skills section.

Note: In order to roll a dice or skill check as a character, you must
be currently speaking as that character.
