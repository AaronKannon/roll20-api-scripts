  "description": "This script provides augmentations (heh) to roll20 for use with Shadowrun 5 character sheets.  Pooled rolls are analyzed for glitches, which are then reported in the chat window. Initiatives rolled via the character sheets are automatically added to the initiative tracker. There is also a **!nextpass** command which can be used by the GM to adjust initiative between combat passes.",
