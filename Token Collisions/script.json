    "description": "# Token Collisions\r\r_v1.3 Updates:_\r* Supports circle-to-rectangle token collisions.\r\rThis script provides a small library for checking for collisions between\rtokens. It provides no functionality by itself, but it is used by other\rscripts such as ```It's A Trap``` and ```World Map Discovery```.\r\r## Rectangular tokens\r\rBy default, all tokens are assumed to be circular with a diameter equal to their\rwidth. You can set a token to be rectangular for this script by setting its\rAura1 to a square.\r\r## API Documentation:\r\rThe following functions are exposed by the ```TokenCollisions``` object:\r\r```\r/**\r * Returns the list of other tokens that some token collided with during\r * its last movement.\r * The tokens are sorted in the order they are collided with.\r * @param {Graphic} token\r * @param {Graphic[]} others\r * @return {Graphic[]}\r */\rfunction getCollisions(token, others)\r```\r\r```\r/**\r * Returns the first token, from some list of tokens, that a token has\r * collided with during its last movement, or undfined if there was\r * no collision.\r * @param {Graphic} token\r * @param {Graphic[]} others\r * @return {Graphic}\r */\rfunction getFirstCollision(token, others)\r```\r",
