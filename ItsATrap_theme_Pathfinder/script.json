    "description": "# It's A Trap! - Pathfinder theme\r\r_3.1 Updates_\r* The trap theme now supports the Rogue Trap Spotter ability.\r\rThis is a Pathfinder trap theme built to support Samuel Marino, Nibrodooh,\rVince, Samuel Terrazas, chris-b, Magik, and James W.'s Pathfinder character sheet.\r\rTo use this theme for the It's A Trap! script, enter 'Pathfinder' for the ```theme``` user option.\r\r## Trap Spotter ability\r\rThis Trap Theme supports the Rogue's Trap Spotter talent. It works for any\rcharacter that has Trap Spotter in the Class Abilities section of their\rcharacter sheet.\r\rWhen the character approaches within 10' of a trap, they will\rautomatically get a perception check to try to notice the trap. The results\rof this check are sent to the GM. If the Perception check is successful, the\rplayers are also alerted about the trap's presence.\r\rThis ability only works with traps whose type is 'trap'. For the character's\rPerception check, it uses their Perception skill total on their character sheet,\rso it doesn't take into account any situational bonuses. It is the GM's job \rto account for any situational bonuses that might contribute to the hidden\rPerception check when the result is displayed to them.\r",
