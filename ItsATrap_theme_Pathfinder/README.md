This is a Pathfinder trap theme built to support Samuel Marino, Nibrodooh,
Vince, Samuel Terrazas, chris-b, Magik, and James W.'s Pathfinder character sheet.

To use this theme for the It's A Trap! script, enter 'Pathfinder' for the ```theme``` user option.

## Trap Spotter ability

This Trap Theme supports the Rogue's Trap Spotter talent. It works for any
character that has Trap Spotter in the Class Abilities section of their
character sheet.

When the character approaches within 10' of a trap, they will
automatically get a perception check to try to notice the trap. The results
of this check are sent to the GM. If the Perception check is successful, the
players are also alerted about the trap's presence.

This ability only works with traps whose type is 'trap'. For the character's
Perception check, it uses their Perception skill total on their character sheet,
so it doesn't take into account any situational bonuses. It is the GM's job
to account for any situational bonuses that might contribute to the hidden
Perception check when the result is displayed to them.
