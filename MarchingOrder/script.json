    "description": "# Marching Order\r\rThis script allows you to select tokens and tell them to follow each other in some specified marching order.\r\r### To set one token to follow another\r\rSelect the token that will be the follower. In the chat, enter the command !follow [leader name]\r\r[leader name] is the name of the token the follower token will be following. You can use this method consecutively for pairs of leader/follower tokens to specify a chain of tokens to be in some marching order. \r\r### To specify several tokens making up a marching order\r\rArrange the tokens in order from west to east, east to west, south to north, or north to south.\r\rSelect all the tokens that will be in the marching order.\r\rIn the chat enter the command !follow [north|east|south|west]\r\rFor !follow north, the northmost token will be the leader in the marching order and the southmost token will be the caboose. The same pattern follows for the other cardinal directions.\r\r### To make tokens stop following each other\r\rJust manually drag-and-drop the token out of the marching order. They will step out of line in the marching order, but the rest of the marching order will be unaffected. If a token was following the token that stepped out of line, they will instead follow the token that the token which stepped out of line was following.",
