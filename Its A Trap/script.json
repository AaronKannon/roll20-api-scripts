    "description": "# It's A Trap!\r\r###### Required Scripts\r* [Token Collisions](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts/tree/master/Token%20Collisions)\r* [Vector Math](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts/tree/master/Vector%20Math)\r\rThis is a script that allows GMs to quickly and very easily set up traps on the GM layer, and detect when tokens on the objects layer move over them. This trap detection even works for tokens moving by waypoints.\r\r### Creating traps:\r\rPlace the token for your trap on the ```GM layer```. Give it the ```cobweb``` <img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/cobweb.png\" width=\"32\"> status marker.\r\r<br/><br/>By default, traps will only affect characters on the ground (ones that don't have a ```wing``` <img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/fluffy-wing.png\" width=\"32\"> or ```angel``` <img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/angel-outfit.png\" width=\"32\"> status marker). To have a trap also affect flying characters, give it the ```wing``` <img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/fluffy-wing.png\" width=\"32\"> or ```angel``` <img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/angel-outfit.png\" width=\"32\"> status marker.\r\r<br/><br/>By default, trap tokens won't appear when they are activated. If you would like the trap to become visible to the players when it is activated, give it the ```bleeding eye``` <img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/bleeding-eye.png\" width=\"32\"> status marker. When the trap is activated, it will be moved to the ```Objects layer```.\r\r### Activating traps:\r\rIf a token moves across a trap at ANY point during its movement, the trap will be activated!",
