This trap detection even works for tokens moving by waypoints.\r\r### To set up traps:\r\rPlace the token for your trap on the GM layer. Give it the cobweb status marker.\r\rBy default, traps will only affect characters on the ground (ones that don't have a wing or angel status marker). To have a trap also affect flying characters, give it the wing or angel status marker.\r\rBy default, trap tokens won't appear when they are activated. If you would like the trap to become visible to the players when it is activated, give it the bleeding eye status marker.\r\r### To set off traps:\r\rIf a token moves across a trap at ANY point during its movement, the trap will be activated!",
