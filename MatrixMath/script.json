    "description": "# Matrix Math\r\rThis script provides a library of matrix mathematical operations for linear algebra and 2D affine transformations. It has no behavior on its own and is meant to be used by other scripts to do neat things, particularly for transforming geometric systems.\r\rAll of this scripts operations are exposed through the ```MatrixMath``` object.\r\r## Other scripts\r\rMatrixMath has no dependencies, but it does play nice with the ```VectorMath``` script's library, particularly for ```MatrixMath.multiply()``` when used to transform a vector.\r\r## Unit tests\rUnit tests are implemented for all its operations, and they run automatically when the script is loaded.\r",
