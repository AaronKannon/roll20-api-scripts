TokenPath

TokenPath continuously tracks the movement of the token at the top of the turn
tracker.  The path is automatically computed, but waypoints can be placed along
it to tweak it as the user desires.


Use:

No special user action is required.  Whenever the token at the top of the turn
tracker moves, its path is automatically updated.  The path is automatically
cleared when the turn changes.

The pips which display a token's path are controlled by the same user(s) as the
token in question.  When a pip is moved, it creates a waypoint, and the path is
automatically updated to pass through that waypoint.  Waypoints are ordered, so
creating a new waypoint B by dragging a pip between existing waypoints A and C
will create a path that passes through A, then B, then C.

Pips display distance based on the page settings (although they are not updated
retroactively if the page settings are changed while a path is visible).
