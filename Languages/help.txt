Languages:
This script allows users to speak in multiple languages and only displays the meaning of the speaker's words to online users who are "speaking as" a character that has that language in their character sheet.

Example Commands:
>!Dwarven hello (if the character who says this has dwarven in their languages on their character sheet, they will say hello in dwarven)
>!Celestial hello (same as before but celestial)

How To Test:
1. Make sure that each character has their approprate languages inserted into their character sheet.
2. Make sure that atleast two players are online and "Speaking As" a character who knows the same langugage.
3. Have one character execute a language command with that language. ("!Infernal hello there")

Future Plans:
- Create command for adding customized langugages.

Bugs:
- Offline users are rarely sent the translated version of the language but this is hard to recreate.
