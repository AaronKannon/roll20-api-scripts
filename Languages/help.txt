Introduction:
This script is a re-work of "WhatSaywithUnknown.js" by derekkoehl which is an enhancement on "What Did He Say?" by Stephen S.

Command 1:
!theLanguage {theText}
Example:
!Draconic hello there dragonborn
Result:
- If the player who types this is speaking as a character that has Draconic (under languages on their character sheet), they will say "hello there dragonborn" in Draconic. Any player who is speaking as a character that also has Draconic on their character sheet will be whispered "hello there dragonborn". Others will be whispered symbols representing the language.
- If the player who types this is speaking as a character that does not have Draconic(under languages on their character sheet), they will "pretend to speak" Draconic.
- If the player who types this is speaking as a player, they will be notified that players cannot speak character languages.
- GMs can speak any language with any player or character

Command 2:
!setLanguageTag {attribute}
Example:
!setLanguageTag playerlanguages
Result:
- If the player who types this is a GM and playerlanguages is an attribute that exists on the character sheets, the script will use that attribute when it searches for player's languages

Languages:
Abyssal Aquan Auran Celestial Common Draconic Druidic
Druidic Dwarven Elven Giant Gnome Goblin Gnoll
Halfling Ignan Infernal Orc Sylvan Terran ThievesCant
Undercommon Unknown

Future Plans:
Create command for adding customized languages
