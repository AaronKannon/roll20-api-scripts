Introduction:
This script is a re-work of "WhatSaywithUnknown.js" by derekkoehl which is an enhancement on "What Did He Say?" by Stephen S.

Command:
!theLanguage {theText}	

Result:
-If the player who types this is speaking as a character that has theLanguage (under languages on their character sheet), they will say {theText} in theLanguage . Any player who is speaking as a character that also has theLanguage on their character sheet will be whispered {theText}. Others will be whispered symbols representing the language.

-If the player who types this is speaking as a character that does not have theLanguage (under languages on their character sheet), they will "Pretend to Speak" theLanguage .

-If the player who types this is speaking as a player, they will be notified that players cannot speak character languages.

-The GM is whispered {theText}.

Languages:
Abyssal	Aquan	Auran	Celestial	Common	Draconic	Druidic
Druidic	Dwarven	Elven	Giant	Gnome	Goblin	Gnoll

Future Plans:
